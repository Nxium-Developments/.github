# ✨ Welcome to Nxium Developments ✨
A Organization that aims to intergrate Multiple Softwares
and create their own Software Products Ecosystem.

### What we are doing 🛰️

We have currently worked on NextLanguage a computer language 💻
that aims to take security to the next level with multiple
intergrated security measures that aims to protect any files and
data written with it securely. Although this language is still
under major development, it shows massive signs of improvement
with each release they improves the filesystem, security measures
and many more.

We have now moved on to developing NextLibrary using NextLanguage
that they will use for all of their products, NextLibrary serves as
a major requirement for their Software. If not installed the product
may not work, with many features of NextLanguage now beginning to
require NextLibrary to work.
